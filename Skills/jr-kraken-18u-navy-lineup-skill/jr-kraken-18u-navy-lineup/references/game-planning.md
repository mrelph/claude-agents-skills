## Opponent Scouting Framework

### Basic Information

**Team Identity Questions**:
1. What's their style? (Skill-based? Physical? Defensive?)
2. How many lines do they roll? (2-3-4?)
3. Strengths? (PP? Speed? Size?)
4. Weaknesses? (Defense? Goaltending? Depth?)

### Key Scouting Areas

#### Forwards
- **Top line identification**: Who are their best forwards?
- **Scoring threats**: Who scores their goals?
- **Physical players**: Who do we need to be aware of?
- **Speed demons**: Do they have breakaway threats?

#### Defense
- **How many D?**: 6? 7? 8? (We have 9 - usually an advantage)
- **Top pair**: Who are their shutdown defenders?
- **Weak link**: Can we target a specific D-man?
- **Puck movers**: Do they have skilled D who jump up?

#### Goaltending
- **Starter**: Who's their #1?
- **Strengths**: Positioning? Reflexes? Puck handling?
- **Weaknesses**: Low shots? High shots? Rebounds?
- **Strategy**: How do we beat them? (Traffic? Five-hole? Corners?)

#### Special Teams
- **Power play**: What formation? (Umbrella? Overload?) Who are threats?
- **Penalty kill**: Aggressive or passive? Easy to beat?
- **Discipline**: Do they take penalties? Can we get PPs?

#### Team Style
- **Speed vs Skill vs Physical**: What's their primary approach?
- **Forecheck intensity**: Do they pressure hard?
- **Defensive structure**: Do they collapse or stay aggressive?
- **Line matching**: Do they try to match lines?

## Step-by-Step Lineup Construction

### Step 1: Confirm Available Players

**List all available players by position**:

Available Forwards: _______________
Available Defense: _______________
Available Goalies: _______________

**Identify absences and plan F/D player moves**:
- Missing forwards? → Move _______ from D to F
- Missing defense? → Move _______ from F to D

### Step 2: Build Top Forward Line

**Standard (Full Roster)**:
- LW: Marsh (1.00) or Freeman (1.50)
- C: Relph (1.00)
- RW: Freeman (1.50) or Marsh (1.00)

**Alternative (If Marsh or Relph Absent)**:
- Use Klakring (1.50), Silliker (1.50), McCredy (1.75)
- Promote best available players

**Key Principle**: Put your best three forwards together

### Step 3: Build Defensive Pairs

**Pair 1 (Shutdown)**:
- Standard: Young (1.75) - Berry (2.00)
- Alternative: Young (1.75) - Marsh (1.00) if not playing forward

**Pair 2 (Two-Way)**:
- Standard: Butler (2.00) - Freeman (1.50) OR Tegart (2.00)
- Flexible based on who's playing forward

**Pair 3 (Sheltered)**:
- Standard: Thompson (3.00) - Silliker (1.50) OR Berry (2.00)
- **CRITICAL**: Thompson ALWAYS with strong partner

**Flexibility Note**: With 9 D-capable players, you have OPTIONS. Use them!

### Step 4: Build Second Forward Line

**Standard**:
- LW: Klakring (1.50)
- C: Silliker (1.50)
- RW: McCredy (1.75)

**Adjust based on top line**:
- If Klakring on Line 1, move Bagga (2.00) up
- If Silliker needed on defense, move Herrick (2.00) up
- Keep this line strong and reliable

**Key Principle**: Two-way responsibility, can play in all situations

### Step 5: Build Third Forward Line

**Standard**:
- LW: Bagga (2.00)
- C: Herrick (2.00)
- RW: Jaeger (2.00)

**Energy/grind line**: High work rate, physical, simple play

**Adjust based on availability**:
- Missing one? Add Tegart (2.00) or Berry (2.00) from defense
- Missing two? Consider collapsing to three-line system

### Step 6: Build Fourth Forward Line (Development)

**Standard**:
- LW: Berry (2.00) or Tegart (2.00)
- C: Cram (2.50) ⚠️ Needs sheltering
- RW: Tegart (2.00) or Berry (2.00)

**Key Principles for Line 4**:
- Cram MUST have strong linemates (2.00 rated)
- Shorter shifts (45-60 seconds)
- Offensive zone starts when possible
- Limited use in critical situations

**Three-Line System Alternative**:
- Don't use Line 4 in close/playoff games
- Cram gets spot duty (5 minutes) with Line 3 players

### Step 7: Assign Special Teams

**Power Play 1**:
- Forwards: Marsh, Relph, Freeman, Klakring (best skill)
- Defense: Young (1.75) or Berry (2.00)

**Power Play 2**:
- Forwards: Silliker, McCredy, Herrick, Bagga
- Defense: Berry or Butler

**Penalty Kill 1**:
- Forwards: Silliker, Tegart OR Freeman, McCredy
- Defense: Young, Butler

**Penalty Kill 2**:
- Forwards: Herrick, Jaeger, Bagga
- Defense: Berry, Tegart, Butler (rotate)

### Step 8: Identify Situational Players

**Late Game, Protecting Lead**:
- Forwards: Marsh-Relph-Freeman OR Klakring-Silliker-McCredy
- Defense: Young-Butler or Young-Berry
- **DO NOT USE**: Cram or Thompson

**Late Game, Need Goal**:
- Forwards: Marsh-Relph-Freeman (all hands on deck)
- Defense: Young-Marsh OR Young-Berry (if Marsh on forward)
- Extra Attacker: Klakring or Silliker

**Overtime (3v3)**:
- Shift 1: Marsh-Relph-Young
- Shift 2: Freeman-Silliker-Butler  
- Shift 3: Klakring-McCredy-Berry

### vs Paul's White Team (Primary Rival)

**Pre-Game Scout**:
- **Their strengths**: 4 elite forwards (1.25), speed-based attack, strong PP
- **Their weaknesses**: Only 6 D-capable players, top-heavy roster, two 3.00+ development players
- **Key players**: Absalonson, Owens, Stroud, Tijerina, Somm, Younker-Agarwal

**Our Game Plan**:

**Tactical Focus** (Pick 2-3):

## In-Game Adjustments

### Adjustment Triggers

**When to Adjust Lines**:
- Line is getting dominated (multiple shifts in own zone)
- Chemistry is off (not connecting on passes)
- Need matchup change (opponent exploiting weakness)
- Injuries/fatigue require changes
- Score/situation demands different approach

**When to Adjust Pairs**:
- Defense pair getting beat repeatedly
- Thompson is overwhelmed (needs stronger partner)
- Need more offense from D (move Marsh to D)
- Need defensive stability (move Freeman to D)

**When to Adjust Special Teams**:
- PP going 0-for-3+ (not working, try PP2 or different formation)
- PK struggling (switch personnel, adjust system)
- Opponents exploiting specific matchup

### Common In-Game Adjustments

#### 1. Line Shuffle (Forwards Not Clicking)

**Problem**: Lines 2-3-4 not producing

**Solution**: Mix and match 2.00 rated players
- Bagga, Berry, Butler, Herrick, Jaeger, Tegart are all 2.00
- Try different combinations
- Keep Cram with strong linemates

**Example**:
```
Before:
Line 2: Klakring-Silliker-McCredy
Line 3: Bagga-Herrick-Jaeger
Line 4: Berry-Cram-Tegart

After (shuffle):
Line 2: Klakring-Silliker-McCredy (keep this together)
Line 3: Bagga-Herrick-Berry
Line 4: Tegart-Cram-Jaeger
```

#### 2. Move Marsh or Relph to Defense

**Problem**: Defense is struggling OR need more offense from back end

**Solution**: Move Marsh (1.00) to defense

**Example**:
```
Before:
Line 1: Marsh-Relph-Freeman
Pair 1: Young-Berry

After:
Line 1: Freeman-Relph-Klakring
Pair 1: Young-Marsh
```

**Impact**: Strengthens defense, adjusts forward lineup

#### 3. Three-Line System (Need More from Top Players)

**Problem**: Game is close, need best players on ice more

**Solution**: Collapse to three lines

**Example**:
```
Before (Four Lines):
Line 1: Marsh-Relph-Freeman (35% ice time)
Line 2: Klakring-Silliker-McCredy (30%)
Line 3: Bagga-Herrick-Jaeger (20%)
Line 4: Berry-Cram-Tegart (15%)

After (Three Lines):
Line 1: Marsh-Relph-Freeman (45% ice time)
Line 2: Klakring-Silliker-McCredy (40%)
Line 3: Bagga-Herrick-Jaeger (15%)
Spot Duty: Tegart (5-8 min), Cram (2-5 min)
```

#### 4. Thompson Protection Adjustment

**Problem**: Thompson (3.00) is getting overwhelmed

**Solution**: Shorten his shifts, improve his partner

**Example**:
```
Before:
Pair 3: Thompson-Tegart (60 sec shifts)

After:
Pair 3: Thompson-Young (45 sec shifts)
(Move Young from Pair 1, adjust others)
```

**OR**: Reduce his ice time significantly, use other D more

#### 5. Special Teams Personnel Change

**Problem**: Power play not scoring, penalty kill struggling

**Solution**: Try different personnel or formation

**PP Example**:
```
If PP1 is cold (0-for-3+):
- Try PP2 for next opportunity
- OR change PP1 personnel (swap Klakring for McCredy)
- OR change formation (umbrella to overload)
```

**PK Example**:
```
If PK1 is struggling:
- Try PK2 personnel
- Adjust system (box+1 to passive box)
- Use most reliable defensive players
```

## Tournament-Specific Strategy

### Multi-Game Weekend Planning

**Tournament Structure Understanding**:
- Pool play (2-3 games) → Playoffs (1-3 games)
- Back-to-back games (fatigue factor)
- Importance escalates (pool play vs semifinals vs finals)

### Tournament Game Strategy

**Pool Play Games (Development Focus)**:

**Approach**: Four-line system, balanced ice time, everyone contributes

**Lineup**:
- Roll all four lines evenly
- Give Cram significant ice time (12-15 min)
- Thompson gets safe minutes (8-12 min)
- Both goalies get starts

**Goals**:
- Get everyone involved
- Build confidence
- Assess what's working
- Prepare for playoffs

**Playoff Games (Competitive Focus)**:

**Approach**: Three-line system (or compressed four-line), best players more ice time

**Lineup**:
- Top line 40-45% ice time
- Cram limited minutes (5-8 min), very sheltered
- Thompson limited minutes (6-10 min) with strong partner
- Hot goalie gets preference

**Goals**:
- Win the game
- Best players in critical situations
- Still give everyone a chance to contribute
- Trust the depth that got us here

### Back-to-Back Games

**Game 1 (Friday night)**:
- Normal four-line approach
- Starter: Haffey (example)
- Full energy, don't hold back

**Game 2 (Saturday morning/afternoon)**:
- Slightly reduce ice time for top players (save energy for potential Game 3)
- Starter: Schuchart (alternate)
- Manage fatigue

**Game 3 (Saturday evening/Sunday)**:
- Assess energy levels
- Hot goalie gets start
- May need to compress to three lines if tired
