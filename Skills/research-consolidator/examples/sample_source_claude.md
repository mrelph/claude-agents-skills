# AI Chip Market Analysis - Claude Research Output

## Key Findings

Research shows the global AI chip market is projected to grow at 25-30% CAGR through 2028.

- NVIDIA maintains dominant market position with approximately 80% of training chip market
- AMD and Intel are gaining share in inference workloads, particularly in enterprise deployments
- Custom silicon (Google TPUs, Amazon Trainium) represents a growing threat to merchant silicon
- The market is expected to reach $150-180 billion by 2028

## Risks

However, there is uncertainty about sustained demand post-2026 as enterprises optimize inference efficiency. Supply chain constraints in advanced packaging (CoWoS) may limit near-term growth.

## Recommendations

Organizations should diversify AI compute strategies rather than relying solely on NVIDIA GPUs.
