# Market Benchmarks and Comparison Standards

This document provides reference information for comparing portfolio performance and allocation against market standards.

## Major Market Indices

When evaluating portfolio performance, the choice of benchmark is critical. The benchmark should reflect the portfolio's investment style and asset allocation. Here are the primary indices used for comparison:

### US Equity Indices

**S&P 500**: This is the most widely used benchmark for US large-cap stocks. It represents approximately 500 of the largest publicly traded companies in the United States and covers about 80% of the US equity market by capitalization. When someone has a portfolio focused on large US companies, this is the primary comparison point. The S&P 500 has historically returned around 10% annually over long periods, though with significant year-to-year variation.

**Dow Jones Industrial Average**: While famous, this is actually a less useful benchmark because it only includes 30 companies and uses a price-weighted methodology. It's better for tracking sentiment than for portfolio comparison.

**NASDAQ Composite**: This index is heavily weighted toward technology companies since it includes all stocks listed on the NASDAQ exchange. It's useful for comparing tech-heavy portfolios but less relevant for diversified holdings.

**Russell 2000**: This benchmark tracks small-cap US stocks, representing the smallest 2000 companies in the Russell 3000 index. Small-cap stocks typically show higher volatility than large-caps and may outperform in risk-on market environments while underperforming when investors seek safety.

**Russell 3000**: This provides broad US market exposure, covering large, mid, and small-cap stocks. It's useful for portfolios that span multiple market capitalizations.

### International Equity Indices

**MSCI EAFE**: This index covers developed markets outside North America (Europe, Australasia, Far East). It's the standard benchmark for international developed market exposure and should be used when evaluating international stock holdings.

**MSCI Emerging Markets**: This tracks stocks in emerging economies like China, India, Brazil, and others. Emerging markets offer higher growth potential but come with increased political and currency risk.

**MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI)**: This represents the global equity market, including both developed and emerging markets. It's useful for truly global portfolios.

### Fixed Income Benchmarks

**Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index**: This is the primary benchmark for US investment-grade bonds, including government, corporate, and mortgage-backed securities. It's what you'd compare against for the bond portion of a balanced portfolio.

**US Treasury yields**: The 10-year Treasury yield is the risk-free rate benchmark. All other investments should be evaluated relative to what you could earn risk-free in Treasuries.

### Sector Indices

When a portfolio shows concentration in specific sectors, compare against sector-specific indices:

**Technology**: S&P 500 Information Technology Index or NASDAQ-100  
**Healthcare**: S&P 500 Healthcare Index  
**Financials**: S&P 500 Financials Index  
**Energy**: S&P 500 Energy Index  
**Real Estate**: MSCI US REIT Index  

## Blended Benchmark Construction

Most portfolios shouldn't be compared to a single index because they contain multiple asset classes. Instead, construct a blended benchmark that matches the portfolio's target allocation.

For example, a portfolio that's 60% US stocks, 30% international stocks, and 10% bonds should be compared against a benchmark that combines 60% S&P 500 returns, 30% MSCI EAFE returns, and 10% Bloomberg Aggregate Bond returns.

This approach ensures you're comparing apples to apples and accounts for the portfolio's strategic asset allocation decisions.

## Typical Market Returns by Asset Class

These are rough guidelines for long-term average returns, useful for setting expectations:

**US Large-Cap Stocks** (S&P 500): Approximately 10% annually over long periods, with standard deviation around 15-20%. However, year-to-year returns vary dramatically from -40% to +30% or more.

**US Small-Cap Stocks** (Russell 2000): Historically slightly higher returns than large-caps (11-12% annually) but with higher volatility (20-25% standard deviation). Small-caps tend to outperform in economic expansions and underperform in recessions.

**International Developed Markets** (MSCI EAFE): Similar long-term returns to US stocks (8-10% annually) but with periods of significant divergence. Currency fluctuations add an additional layer of volatility.

**Emerging Markets** (MSCI EM): Higher historical returns (10-12% annually) come with significantly higher volatility (25-30% standard deviation) and greater downside risk during crises.

**Investment-Grade Bonds** (Bloomberg Aggregate): Lower returns (4-6% annually) with much lower volatility (4-6% standard deviation). Bonds provide stability and income but limited growth.

**Cash and Cash Equivalents**: Returns typically track short-term interest rates, currently ranging from 4-5% but historically averaging 2-3%. Minimal volatility but inflation risk.

## Risk-Adjusted Performance Metrics

Raw returns don't tell the full story because they ignore risk. Use these metrics for more sophisticated analysis:

**Sharpe Ratio**: Measures return per unit of total risk (volatility). Calculated as (Portfolio Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Portfolio Standard Deviation. Higher is better. A Sharpe ratio above 1.0 is considered good, above 2.0 is excellent.

**Sortino Ratio**: Similar to Sharpe but only considers downside volatility, ignoring upside fluctuations. This is often more intuitive since investors don't mind positive volatility.

**Alpha**: Measures excess return relative to a benchmark after adjusting for market risk. Positive alpha suggests skill or luck in outperforming. However, very few managers generate consistent positive alpha after fees.

**Beta**: Measures sensitivity to market movements. A beta of 1.0 means the portfolio moves in line with the market. Beta above 1.0 means higher volatility (amplifies market swings), below 1.0 means lower volatility.

## Market Cycle Considerations

Portfolio performance should be evaluated with awareness of where we are in the market cycle:

**Bull Markets**: Growth stocks and small-caps often outperform. High-beta portfolios shine. Concentration risk feels rewarded. Don't confuse a rising tide with investment genius.

**Bear Markets**: Quality defensive stocks, bonds, and low-beta portfolios hold up better. Diversification proves its value. Over-concentration in winners becomes painful.

**Low Volatility Periods**: Risk-taking feels safe and gets rewarded. Complex strategies proliferate. This creates complacency that sets up the next volatility spike.

**High Volatility Periods**: Flight to quality. Correlations increase (diversification works less well). Liquidity matters more. Simple beats complex.

## Current Market Context (as of analysis date)

When conducting analysis, always gather current market information to understand the present environment. Key questions to answer:

What are current valuations (P/E ratios) relative to historical averages? High valuations suggest lower future returns, low valuations suggest higher future returns.

What is the Federal Reserve doing with interest rates? Rising rates typically pressure stock valuations, especially growth stocks. Falling rates support asset prices.

What sectors are leading the market currently? Leadership often rotates based on economic cycle, and yesterday's winners may not be tomorrow's.

What are the primary risks investors are focused on? (inflation, recession, geopolitical tensions, policy changes)

How does the portfolio position itself relative to these factors?
