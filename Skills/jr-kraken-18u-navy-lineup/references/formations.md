## Forward Line Structures

### Four-Line System (PRIMARY APPROACH ⭐)

**When to Use**:
- Most regular season games
- Pool play in tournaments
- Games where we want to wear opponents down
- When we have full roster available
- Against teams that use 2-3 lines (exploit depth advantage)

**Philosophy**: Roll four lines, keep everyone fresh, dominate third period

**Line Structure**:

```
LINE 1 - Elite/Offensive (35-40% ice time)
LW: Marsh (1.00)    C: Relph (1.00)    RW: Freeman (1.50)
Focus: Offensive production, top matchup line, all special teams

LINE 2 - Skilled/Two-Way (30-35% ice time)
LW: Klakring (1.50)    C: Silliker (1.50)    RW: McCredy (1.75)
Focus: Two-way play, reliable in all situations, PP2 and PK

LINE 3 - Grind/Energy (20-25% ice time)
LW: Bagga (2.00)    C: Herrick (2.00)    RW: Jaeger (2.00)
Focus: Energy, physicality, forecheck, defensive responsibility

LINE 4 - Depth/Development (10-15% ice time)
LW: Berry (2.00)    C: Cram (2.50)    RW: Tegart (2.00)
Focus: Sheltered minutes for Cram, energy shifts, simple assignments
```

**Rotation Strategy**:
- Line 1 → Line 2 → Line 3 → Line 4 → repeat
- Shorten Line 4 shifts (45-60 seconds vs 60-90 for Lines 1-3)
- Double-shift Line 1 in critical situations
- Line 3 can play more if Line 4 is struggling

**Advantages**:
- Everyone stays engaged
- Fresh legs all game
- Third period dominance (opponents tire, we don't)
- Can handle absences easily
- Development opportunities for Cram

### Three-Line System (COMPETITIVE GAMES)

**When to Use**:
- Close playoff games
- Against very strong opponents
- When Thompson is unavailable (need Berry on defense more)
- Late in close games
- When we need maximum firepower

**Philosophy**: Best players get more ice time, but everyone still plays

**Line Structure**:

```
LINE 1 - Elite (40-45% ice time)
LW: Marsh (1.00)    C: Relph (1.00)    RW: Freeman (1.50)
Focus: Carry the offense, dominate shifts

LINE 2 - Skilled (35-40% ice time)
LW: Klakring (1.50)    C: Silliker (1.50)    RW: McCredy (1.75)
Focus: Two-way dominance, eat minutes

LINE 3 - Energy/Depth (20-25% ice time)
LW: Bagga (2.00)    C: Herrick (2.00)    RW: Jaeger (2.00)
Focus: High-energy shifts, simple play, tire opponents

SPOT DUTY:
- Tegart (2.00): 5-8 minutes, energy shifts
- Cram (2.50): 3-5 minutes, very sheltered, offensive zone only
```

**Rotation Strategy**:
- Line 1 → Line 2 → Line 1 → Line 3 → repeat (double-shift top line)
- Spot duty players fill in on changes
- Line 1 and 2 can play back-to-back shifts if needed
- Line 3 matches against opponent's weak line

**Advantages**:
- Maximum ice time for best players
- Can match up against elite opponents
- Still have depth when needed
- Cram and Tegart still contribute

## Defense Pair Structures

### Three-Pair System (STANDARD ⭐)

**When to Use**: Most games with full roster

**Pair Structure**:

```
PAIR 1 - Top/Shutdown (40-45% ice time)
LD: Young (1.75)    RD: Berry (2.00) or Marsh (1.00)
Focus: Against opponent's top line, defensive responsibility, PK

PAIR 2 - Two-Way/Balanced (35-40% ice time)  
LD: Butler (2.00)    RD: Freeman (1.50) or Tegart (2.00)
Focus: All situations, reliable, can jump into rush

PAIR 3 - Development/Sheltered (20-25% ice time)
LD: Thompson (3.00)    RD: Silliker (1.50) or Berry (2.00)
Focus: Sheltered minutes for Thompson, offensive zone starts
```

**Note**: Actual pairs can vary based on who's playing forward vs defense

**Rotation Strategy**:
- Pair 1 → Pair 2 → Pair 3 → repeat
- Shorten Pair 3 shifts (45-60 seconds)
- Can run Pairs 1 and 2 back-to-back if needed
- Thompson ALWAYS with experienced partner

**Advantages**:

PAIR 3: Berry (2.00) - Tegart (2.00)
PAIR 4: Thompson (3.00) - Silliker (1.50)
```

**Rotation**: Equal-ish shifts (Pair 4 slightly less)

**Advantages**:
- Maximum freshness
- Everyone contributes
- Can handle multiple games

## Player Rotation Guidelines

### Forward Shift Length

**Line 1**: 60-90 seconds (can extend in critical situations)
**Line 2**: 60-90 seconds (workhorses, eat minutes)
**Line 3**: 60-75 seconds (high energy, shorter shifts)
**Line 4**: 45-60 seconds (keep Cram fresh, limit exposure)

## Special Deployment: F/D Versatile Players

### Six Versatile Players

1. **Marsh (1.00)** - Elite at both F and D
2. **Relph (1.00)** - Elite at both F and D
3. **Freeman (1.50)** - Strong at both F and D
4. **Silliker (1.50)** - Primarily F, can play D
5. **Berry (2.00)** - Solid at both F and D
6. **Tegart (2.00)** - Solid at both F and D

### When to Move Players

**Move Forward to Defense**:
- Defense injury/absence during game
- Need more defensive structure
- Protecting a lead
- Opponent has weak offensive attack

**Move Defense to Forward**:
- Forward injury/absence during game
- Need more offensive firepower
- Chasing a goal
- Have too many defensemen (rare)

### Common Adjustments

**Most Flexible**: Marsh, Relph (elite at both)
**Easy Moves**: Freeman, Berry, Tegart (good at both)
**Emergency Only**: Silliker (primarily forward, but can help on D)

**Example Mid-Game Adjustment**:
- If down a forward: Move Berry or Tegart to forward, balance defensive pairs
- If down a defenseman: Move Freeman to defense, balance forward lines

## Goalie Rotation Strategy

### Season-Long Approach

**Philosophy**: Both goalies split time roughly 50/50

**Haffey**:
- Solid all-around
- Can play forward in emergency
- Give him equal opportunities

**Schuchart**:
- Experienced, can play out
- Can play defense in emergency
- Give him equal opportunities

### Game Assignment Factors

**Start Haffey When**:
- Against skill-based, high-shot teams (rely on positioning)
- Back-to-back games (alternate)
- Strong recent performance

**Start Schuchart When**:
- Against physical, grinding teams
- Back-to-back games (alternate)
- Strong recent performance

**Key Principle**: Recent performance matters most. Ride the hot goalie, but don't completely abandon the other.

### Tournament Strategy

**Pool Play**: Split starts (both get experience)
**Playoffs**: Hot goalie gets preference
**Back-to-Back Days**: Split duty (fresh goalie each game)

## Practice Line Combinations

Use practice time to experiment with lines before using them in games:

### Experimentation Ideas

**Try moving Marsh**:
- Line 1 at forward vs Line 1 at defense
- Which maximizes his impact?

**Test chemistry combinations**:
- Which 2.00 players work well together?
- Can Cram succeed with different linemates?

**Special teams testing**:
- Try different PP formations
- Practice PK pressure system

**Emergency scenarios**:
- Practice with only 4 defensemen
- Practice with only 10 forwards

---

## Keys to Success

### Tactical Discipline

1. **Stay in system** - Don't freelance
2. **Support each other** - Five players working together beats five individuals
3. **Backchecking is mandatory** - Defense starts with forwards
4. **Simple play wins** - Don't overcomplicate

### Line Chemistry Factors

**Good Line Chemistry**:
- Complementary speeds (one fast, one smart)
- Communication on ice
- Willingness to work for each other
- Understanding of roles

**Bad Line Chemistry**:
- All three players want the puck
- Speed mismatches (one too fast/slow)
- Lack of communication
- Unclear roles

### Adjusting on the Fly

**Trust Your Depth**:
- If a line is struggling, try different combinations
- Use F/D players to solve problems
- Don't panic - we have options

**Communication**:
- Tell players why you're making changes
- Explain adjustments clearly
- Keep everyone engaged

## Remember: Our Identity

**We are a FOUR-LINE team.**

We win by grinding opponents down over 60 minutes, using our depth advantage to emerge victorious in third periods, and playing strong defensive hockey.

**Our systems reflect our identity**:
- Four forward lines (spread talent, wear them down)
- Three defensive pairs (9 D-capable players, fresh legs)
- Aggressive penalty kill (we have depth, use it)
- Simple, effective power play (don't overthink)

**Stay true to who we are**: Balanced Depth, defensive structure, everyone contributes, win as a TEAM.
