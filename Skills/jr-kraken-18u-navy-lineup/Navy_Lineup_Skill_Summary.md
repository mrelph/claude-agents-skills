## Special: Playing Paul's White Team

The skill has a dedicated section for your rivalry with Paul's team:

**Their Strengths**:
- 4 elite (1.25) forwards
- Speed-based attack
- Strong power play

**Their Weakness**:
- Only 6 D-capable players (you have 9!)

**Your Strategy**:
1. Heavy forecheck - attack their tired D-men
2. Roll four lines - wear down their limited defense
3. Strong penalty kill - neutralize their PP advantage
4. Physical play - make them work all game
5. Third period dominance - your depth emerges
