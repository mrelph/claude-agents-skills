## Probing Questions to Uncover Savings

Ask these questions even if the user does not mention them:

1. "Did you make any contributions to retirement accounts that weren't through payroll?"
2. "Did you pay for any healthcare expenses out of pocket, including premiums?"
3. "Did you do any work from home, even occasionally?"
4. "Did you pay anyone to watch your children while you worked?"
5. "Did you purchase any major appliances, vehicles, or make home improvements?"
6. "Did you donate anything to charity - money, clothes, household items, or your time?"
7. "Did you have any education expenses for yourself or dependents?"
8. "Did you receive any foreign income or pay foreign taxes?"
9. "Did you sell any investments, including crypto?"
10. "Did you have any side income - gig work, freelancing, selling items online?"
11. "Did you pay student loan interest, even if someone else is legally obligated?"
12. "Did you contribute to a 529 plan? (May have state deduction)"
13. "Do you have any carryforwards from prior years - capital losses, charitable contributions, NOLs?"

## RSU-Specific Discovery Questions

For anyone who mentions RSUs, stock compensation, or works in tech/finance:

1. "Did any RSUs vest this year? If so, how many vesting events and what were the FMV prices?"
2. "Did you sell any RSU shares? Did you keep records of which vesting lots you sold from?"
3. "Have you checked your 1099-B cost basis against your vesting records? (This is often incorrect)"
4. "What is your typical withholding rate on RSU vestings? Is it 22% or higher?"
5. "Do you have RSU vesting statements from your broker (E*TRADE, Fidelity, Schwab, etc.)?"
6. "Are you planning to hold RSU shares for long-term gains, or do you typically sell immediately?"
7. "Have you accounted for RSU income in your estimated tax payments or W-4 withholding?"
8. "Do you have any unvested RSUs that will vest next year? (For tax planning)"
9. "If you left or joined a company this year, were any RSUs forfeited or accelerated?"
10. "Do you also have ISOs, NQSOs, or ESPP shares? (Different tax treatment)"

### RSU Tax Trap Warnings

- **Double Taxation Trap**: If 1099-B shows $0 basis and it is not corrected, tax is paid TWICE on the same income
- **Withholding Shortfall**: 22% federal withholding is often insufficient - actual bracket may be 32-37%
- **Holding Period**: Starts at VESTING, not grant date - selling within 1 year of vesting = short-term gains
- **Lot Identification**: Multiple vestings require tracking which lots are sold for optimal tax treatment
