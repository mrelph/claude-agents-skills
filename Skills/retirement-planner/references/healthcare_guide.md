### Medicare Parts

**Part A (Hospital Insurance)**:
- Premium-free if 40+ quarters of Medicare-taxed employment
- Covers inpatient hospital, skilled nursing, hospice, some home health
- Deductible: $1,676 per benefit period (2025)

### IRMAA Surcharges (Income-Related Monthly Adjustment Amount)

Based on MAGI from **two years prior** (2023 income affects 2025 premiums):

| Filing Status | MAGI Threshold | Part B Premium | Part D Surcharge |
|---------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| Single ≤$103,000 / MFJ ≤$206,000 | Standard | $185.00 | $0 |
| Single $103,001-$129,000 / MFJ $206,001-$258,000 | Tier 1 | $259.00 | $13.70 |
| Single $129,001-$161,000 / MFJ $258,001-$322,000 | Tier 2 | $370.00 | $35.50 |
| Single $161,001-$193,000 / MFJ $322,001-$386,000 | Tier 3 | $480.00 | $57.30 |
| Single $193,001-$500,000 / MFJ $386,001-$750,000 | Tier 4 | $591.00 | $79.00 |
| Single >$500,000 / MFJ >$750,000 | Tier 5 | $628.00 | $85.80 |

**IRMAA Planning Strategies**:
- Time Roth conversions to avoid IRMAA triggers
- Year of retirement may have lower MAGI (appeal possible)
- Life-changing events (retirement, divorce, death of spouse) allow IRMAA reconsideration
- 2-year lookback means planning must start early

### Medigap (Medicare Supplement) Plans

- Covers Part B coinsurance, copayments, and deductibles
- Standardized plans A through N (same benefits regardless of insurer)
- **Plan G** most popular: Covers everything except Part B deductible (~$257/year)
- **Plan N** good value: Lower premium, small copays for office/ER visits
- Premiums: $100-300/month depending on plan, age, location
- Best to enroll during Medigap Open Enrollment (guaranteed issue)

### Medicare Advantage (Part C) Alternative

- Replaces Original Medicare + Medigap with all-in-one plan
- Often includes Part D, dental, vision, hearing
- Network restrictions (HMO/PPO)
- Out-of-pocket maximums (Original Medicare has none)
- Lower premiums but potential for higher costs if seriously ill
- Annual enrollment: October 15 - December 7

## HSA (Health Savings Account) Strategies

### Triple Tax Advantage

1. **Tax-deductible contributions** (reduces current income)
2. **Tax-free growth** (investments grow without tax drag)

|----------|----------|--------------|

### Retirement HSA Strategy

**Before Retirement**:
- Maximize contributions every year
- Invest aggressively (long time horizon)
- Pay medical expenses out-of-pocket, save receipts
- Reimburse yourself years later (no time limit)

**At Retirement**:
- HSA is last account to tap (maximize tax-free growth)
- After age 65, non-medical withdrawals taxed as income (like Traditional IRA, no penalty)
- Medical withdrawals always tax-free
- Covers Medicare premiums (except Medigap), long-term care insurance, out-of-pocket costs

**Target HSA Balance at Retirement**: $100,000-200,000
- Covers Medicare premiums and out-of-pocket costs
- Tax-free medical spending throughout retirement
- Passes to spouse tax-free if named beneficiary

### HSA Eligibility Requirements

- Must be enrolled in High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)
- Not enrolled in Medicare (lose eligibility at 65)
- Not claimed as dependent
- No other non-HDHP coverage

## Long-Term Care Planning

| Nursing home (semi-private) | $8,700 | $104,400 |
| Nursing home (private) | $10,000 | $120,000 |

### Planning Options

**Self-Insurance**:
- Set aside $200,000-500,000 per person
- Invested conservatively for liquidity
- Full flexibility and control
- Risk: May not be enough for extended care needs

**Traditional LTC Insurance**:
- Purchase before age 60 for best rates
- Annual premiums: $2,000-5,000 (can increase over time)
- Inflation protection rider critical
- Elimination period: 90 days typical
- Benefit period: 3-5 years most common
- Tax-qualified policies offer deductible premiums

**Hybrid Life/LTC Policies**:
- Life insurance with LTC benefit rider
- Fixed premiums (cannot increase)
- If LTC not needed, death benefit paid to heirs
- Higher upfront cost but more predictable
- Increasingly popular alternative

**Medicaid (Last Resort)**:
- Requires spending down nearly all assets
- 5-year lookback on asset transfers
- Spousal protections exist but limited
- Quality of care varies
- Should not be a primary planning strategy

### Long-Term Care Statistics

- 70% of people turning 65 will need some form of long-term care
- Average need: 3 years for women, 2.2 years for men
- 20% will need care for more than 5 years

## Healthcare Cost Projections

### Fidelity Retiree Health Care Cost Estimate (2025)

- Average couple age 65: **$365,000** in retirement healthcare costs
- Includes Medicare premiums, Medigap, Part D, out-of-pocket, dental, vision

| 75-84 | $8,000-15,000 | Increasing utilization |

### Planning Assumptions for Monte Carlo

- General healthcare inflation: 5-6% annually (vs 2-3% general inflation)
- Medicare Part B premium growth: ~5% annually
- Out-of-pocket maximum growth: ~3-4% annually
- Plan for at least $300,000-400,000 per couple in healthcare costs
- Add $100,000-300,000 per person for potential long-term care
