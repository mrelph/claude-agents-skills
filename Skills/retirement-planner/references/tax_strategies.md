# Tax-Efficient Retirement Strategies

Strategic approaches to minimize lifetime tax burden in retirement.

## Roth Conversion Strategies

### Why Convert?

**Benefits**:
- Tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement
- No RMDs during lifetime
- Lower future tax brackets (if expected)
- Hedge against tax rate increases
- Tax-free legacy for heirs
- Flexibility in retirement income planning

**Costs**:
- Pay taxes now at current rates
- Increases current year taxable income
- May trigger IRMAA or other income-based thresholds
- Opportunity cost of taxes paid

### Optimal Conversion Windows

**Pre-retirement (age 55-62)**:
- Lower income years after leaving work but before SS
- Fill up 12% or 22% bracket
- Avoid pushing into higher brackets unnecessarily

**Early retirement (age 62-70)**:
- After retirement, before Social Security starts
- Ideal: Convert while in 12-22% brackets
- Stop or reduce conversions once SS begins (higher income)

**Example strategy**:
```
Age 62-70: Retire, delay SS to 70
Convert enough each year to fill 22% bracket (~$94k-$201k MFJ)
Result: 8 years of conversions, significantly reduce Traditional IRA balance before RMDs
```

### Bracket Management

**Fill the bracket approach**:
1. Calculate taxable income before conversion
2. Determine distance to top of target bracket (12%, 22%, or 24%)
3. Convert exactly enough to reach top of bracket
4. Repeat annually

**Example (Married Filing Jointly, 2024)**:
- Current income: $50,000
- Top of 12% bracket: $94,300
- Available conversion space: $44,300
- Convert $44,300 from Traditional to Roth, pay ~$5,300 tax at 12%

**Watch for**:
- Capital gains stacking (add to income)
- Qualified dividends (preferential rates but still stack)
- Standard deduction use (maximize bracket filling)

### IRMAA Considerations

Medicare surcharges based on income from 2 years prior create Roth conversion complications:

**IRMAA cliffs** (2024, see retirement_rules.md for full table):
- $103k (single) / $206k (married): First tier (+$82/month/person)
- $129k / $258k: Second tier (+$208/month/person)
- $161k / $322k: Third tier (+$333/month/person)

**Planning approach**:
- Age 63-65: Be cautious with conversions (affects Medicare at 65-67)
- Consider converting more in year 1, less in year 2 to alternate IRMAA years
- Once on Medicare, plan conversions to stay below next IRMAA tier

### Multi-Year Conversion Planning

**Goal**: Convert enough to meaningfully reduce RMDs while minimizing tax cost

**Framework**:
1. Project future RMD amounts (use IRS table)
2. Target Traditional IRA balance that produces acceptable RMD
3. Work backwards: How much to convert annually?
4. Optimize conversions across years to minimize total tax

**Example**:
- Current Trad IRA: $800k at age 60
- Projected at 73 (7% growth): $1.4M
- RMD at 73: $51k (3.65% of balance)
- Goal: Reduce to $600k by 73, producing $22k RMD
- Need to convert: ~$800k over 13 years = $60k/year average
- Adjust annually based on market performance and tax situation

## Withdrawal Sequencing

### Standard Sequence (Conventional Wisdom)

**Order**:
1. Taxable accounts (brokerage)
2. Tax-deferred (Traditional IRA, 401k)
3. Tax-free (Roth IRA)

**Rationale**:
- Taxable: Capital gains rates often lower, basis recovery, step-up at death
- Tax-deferred: Spread over retirement, manage brackets
- Roth: Last resort, maximize tax-free growth, best legacy asset

### Proportional Withdrawal Alternative

**Approach**: Withdraw from all account types proportionally to manage brackets

**Benefits**:
- Smoother tax burden over retirement
- Reduces RMD shock when they begin
- Maintains diversification of tax treatments
- Flexibility to adjust based on annual tax situation

**Example (60% taxable, 30% trad IRA, 10% Roth)**:
- Need $60k/year spending
- Withdraw $36k taxable, $18k IRA, $6k Roth
- Keeps all balances proportional
- Prevents Traditional IRA from dominating in later years

### Dynamic Sequencing

**Adjust based on**:
- Current tax bracket vs future expected bracket
- Market performance (withdrawal from winners for rebalancing)
- Healthcare subsidies or other income-tested benefits
- Tax law changes

**Strategies**:
- Low-income year: Take more from tax-deferred (or do Roth conversion)
- High-income year: Use Roth or taxable (minimize additional income)
- Bear market: Harvest losses in taxable, use tax-deferred for spending
- Bull market: Realize gains in taxable, preserve tax-deferred

## Account Location Optimization

### Tax-Efficient Asset Placement

**Tax-deferred accounts (Traditional IRA, 401k)**:
- Bonds and fixed income (high ordinary income tax rates)
- REITs (dividends taxed as ordinary income)
- Actively managed funds (high turnover)
- High-yield bonds

**Roth accounts**:
- High-growth stocks (maximize tax-free compounding)
- Small-cap/emerging markets (high expected returns)
- Assets you'll hold long-term
- Best assets for legacy planning

**Taxable accounts**:
- Tax-efficient index funds (low turnover)
- Municipal bonds (already tax-advantaged)
- Hold-forever stocks (defer gains, step-up at death)
- Anything you might donate (can donate appreciated securities)

### Rebalancing Tax Efficiency

**In tax-deferred/Roth**: Rebalance freely (no tax consequences)

**In taxable**:
- Use new contributions to rebalance (avoid selling)
- Harvest losses when rebalancing (offset gains or income)
- If must sell winners, consider long-term capital gains (lower rate)

## Tax-Loss Harvesting in Retirement

**Strategy**: Sell investments at a loss to offset gains or income

**Benefits**:
- Offset capital gains dollar-for-dollar
- Offset up to $3,000 ordinary income annually
- Carry forward unused losses indefinitely
- Reset cost basis while maintaining market exposure

**Wash sale rule**: Can't buy "substantially identical" security within 30 days before/after sale

**Retirement-specific considerations**:
- Less valuable if in low brackets (15% or lower may have 0% cap gains rate)
- Pair with Roth conversions (losses offset conversion income)
- Harvest systematically in down markets (may not have other opportunities)

## Charitable Giving Strategies

### Qualified Charitable Distributions (QCDs)

**Rules**:
- Age 70½+: Can donate up to $105,000/year directly from IRA to charity
- Counts toward RMD but excluded from taxable income
- More valuable than itemized deduction (especially post-TCJA with high standard deduction)

**Strategy**:
- Age 73+: Use QCD to satisfy RMD, avoid increasing AGI
- Effective: Keeps income lower for IRMAA, tax on SS, and other thresholds
- Better than taking RMD and donating cash (even if itemizing)

### Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs)

**Approach**: Bunch multiple years of donations in high-income year

**Process**:
1. Contribute appreciated securities to DAF in high-income year
2. Claim large charitable deduction (exceeds standard deduction)
3. Distribute from DAF to charities over multiple years
4. Use standard deduction in non-contributing years

**Best for**: Lumpy income years (business sale, large bonus, etc.)

## Managing Social Security Taxation

**Taxation of benefits**:
- 0%: "Combined income" under $25k (single) or $32k (married)
- Up to 50%: Combined income $25-34k (single) or $32-44k (married)
- Up to 85%: Combined income over $34k (single) or $44k (married)

**Combined income** = AGI + Non-taxable interest + 50% of SS benefits

**Strategies to reduce taxable SS**:
- Withdraw from Roth (doesn't add to combined income)
- Use taxable account basis (doesn't add to AGI)
- Time Roth conversions before SS starts (avoid increasing income when collecting)
- Consider municipal bonds (interest excluded from combined income)

**Provisional income trap**:
- 50% bracket: Pay tax on $0.50 of SS per $1 of extra income
- 85% bracket: Pay tax on $0.85 of SS per $1 of extra income
- Creates effective marginal rates of 18-27% in 12% bracket, 27-46% in 22% bracket

## State Tax Planning

### State Residency Strategies

**Considerations**:
- 9 states have no income tax: AK, FL, NV, NH, SD, TN, TX, WA, WY
- Some states don't tax retirement income (Social Security, pensions): IL, MS, PA
- Some states don't tax SS but do tax other retirement income

**Relocation timing**:
- Establish residency before large Roth conversions
- Be aware of "exit taxes" (CA, NY for high earners)
- Document residency change clearly (driver's license, voter registration, etc.)

**Part-time residency**: Some use 183-day rule to split time between states

### State-Specific Deductions

Some states offer retirement income exclusions or credits. Research specific state rules:
- Georgia: $35k exclusion for 62+
- New York: Various exclusions by age and income
- Michigan: Tier-based system depending on birth year

## Healthcare Subsidy Optimization (Pre-Medicare)

### ACA Premium Tax Credits

**If retiring before 65**: May qualify for substantial subsidies

**Income target**: 138-400% of Federal Poverty Level
- 2024: $20,783 - $60,240 for individual
- 2024: $43,056 - $124,800 for family of 4

**Strategies**:
- Manage income through withdrawal sequencing (use Roth more)
- Time Roth conversions after Medicare at 65
- Harvest losses to reduce AGI
- Consider part-time work that keeps income in subsidy range

**Cliff at 400% FPL eliminated** (American Rescue Plan, extended through 2025): Now premium is capped at 8.5% of income regardless of income level

## Pre-59½ Early Retirement

### Substantially Equal Periodic Payments (SEPP/72(t))

**Purpose**: Access IRA/401(k) before 59½ without 10% penalty

**Rules**:
- Must take equal payments for 5 years or until age 59½, whichever is longer
- Calculate using IRS-approved methods (RMD, amortization, annuity)
- Cannot change amount once started (except one-time switch to RMD method)
- Applies per account (can do SEPP on portion of IRA)

**Use case**: Bridge early retirement years (55-59½) before penalty-free access

### Roth Conversion Ladder

**Strategy** for early retirees:
1. Convert Traditional IRA to Roth each year
2. Pay tax on conversion
3. Wait 5 years for conversion amount (not earnings) to be accessible penalty-free
4. Withdraw converted amounts after 5 years

**Example**:
- Age 55: Convert $40k (pay ~$5k tax)
- Age 60: Can withdraw that $40k penalty-free
- Repeat annually to create pipeline of accessible funds

**Best for**: Very early retirees (50s) with time to build ladder

## Tax-Efficient Legacy Planning

### Step-Up in Basis

**Taxable accounts get step-up at death**: Cost basis resets to value at death

**Strategy**:
- Hold appreciated assets until death (heirs receive tax-free)
- Spend from tax-deferred accounts, preserve taxable accounts for heirs
- Exception: If in 0% cap gains bracket, realize gains for yourself (reset basis while alive)

### Inherited IRAs (SECURE Act 2.0)

**10-year rule**: Non-spouse beneficiaries must drain inherited IRA within 10 years

**Implications**:
- Less valuable for legacy than pre-2020 (used to stretch over beneficiary's life)
- Roth conversions more valuable (10-year rule applies but distributions tax-free)

**Strategies**:
- Convert Traditional to Roth for better legacy asset
- Consider life insurance for legacy (tax-free death benefit)
- Charitable remainder trusts for large IRAs

### Roth as Ultimate Legacy Asset

**Benefits for heirs**:
- Inherit tax-free
- 10-year distribution period but no tax on withdrawals
- Maximize value if heirs in high brackets

**Strategy**: Prioritize spending Traditional IRA/401(k), preserve Roth for legacy
