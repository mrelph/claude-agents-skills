## Core Tax Preparation Workflow

### Step 1: Gather Basic Information

Ask for:
- Filing status (single, married filing jointly, married filing separately, head of household)
- Number of dependents
- Age (for additional standard deduction)
- State of residence

### Step 2: Collect Income Information

| Income Type | Documents | Key Fields |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Employment | W-2 | Box 1 wages, Box 2 withholding |
| Interest | 1099-INT | Box 1 interest income |
| Dividends | 1099-DIV | Box 1a ordinary, Box 1b qualified |
| Capital Gains | 1099-B | Proceeds, cost basis, gain/loss |
| Self-Employment | 1099-NEC, records | Gross income, expenses |
| Retirement | 1099-R | Distribution, taxable amount |
| Social Security | SSA-1099 | Total benefits, taxable portion |

### Step 3: Identify Deductions

**Above-the-Line Deductions (reduce AGI):**
- Traditional IRA contributions
- HSA contributions
- Self-employment tax (50%)
- Self-employed health insurance
- Student loan interest (up to $2,500)
- Educator expenses (up to $300)

**Itemized vs Standard:**

| Filing Status | 2024 Standard Deduction |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Single | $14,600 |
| Married Filing Jointly | $29,200 |
| Married Filing Separately | $14,600 |
| Head of Household | $21,900 |

*Add $1,550 if 65+ or blind (single/HOH), $1,550 per person if married*

**Itemized Deductions:**
- Medical expenses (over 7.5% of AGI)
- State and local taxes (SALT cap: $10,000)
- Mortgage interest (up to $750K debt)
- Charitable contributions
- Casualty losses (federally declared disasters)

### Step 4: Calculate Tax Credits

**Major Credits to Check:**

| Credit | Maximum | Refundable? |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Child Tax Credit | $2,000/child | Partially ($1,700) |
| Earned Income Tax Credit | Up to $7,830 | Yes |
| Child Care Credit | Up to $2,100 | No |
| American Opportunity | $2,500/student | Partially (40%) |
| Lifetime Learning | $2,000 | No |
| Saver's Credit | $1,000 ($2,000 MFJ) | No |

### Step 5: Calculate Tax Liability

**2024 Tax Brackets (Single):**

| Rate | Income Range |
|------|--------------|
| 10% | $0 - $11,600 |
| 12% | $11,601 - $47,150 |
| 22% | $47,151 - $100,525 |
| 24% | $100,526 - $191,950 |
| 32% | $191,951 - $243,725 |
| 35% | $243,726 - $609,350 |
| 37% | Over $609,350 |

**2024 Tax Brackets (Married Filing Jointly):**

| Rate | Income Range |
|------|--------------|
| 10% | $0 - $23,200 |
| 12% | $23,201 - $94,300 |
| 22% | $94,301 - $201,050 |
| 24% | $201,051 - $383,900 |
| 32% | $383,901 - $487,450 |
| 35% | $487,451 - $731,200 |
| 37% | Over $731,200 |

## Proactive Tax Reduction Discovery

### Ask These Probing Questions

1. Did you work from home at all? (home office deduction)
2. Did you make any charitable donations? (cash, goods, mileage)
3. Do you have a high-deductible health plan? (HSA opportunity)
4. Did you pay for childcare to work? (dependent care credit)
5. Are you paying student loans? (interest deduction)
6. Did you make any energy-efficient home improvements? (energy credits)
7. Did you contribute to retirement accounts? (IRA, 401k)
8. Did you have any medical expenses? (may exceed 7.5% threshold)
9. Did you move for work? (some states allow deduction)
10. Do you have investment losses? (harvest against gains)
11. Did you pay for college expenses? (education credits)
12. Are you self-employed? (many deductions available)
13. Did you make estimated tax payments? (ensure credit)

### Commonly Overlooked Deductions

**For Homeowners:**
- Mortgage points paid
- PMI premiums (if AGI qualifies)
- Property taxes (within SALT cap)
- Home office (if self-employed)

**For Investors:**
- Investment expenses
- Capital loss carryforward
- Tax-loss harvesting opportunities
- Qualified dividends (lower rate)

**For Parents:**
- Child Tax Credit
- Child and Dependent Care Credit
- Education credits (AOTC, LLC)
- Adoption credit

**For Self-Employed:**
- Home office deduction
- Vehicle expenses (67¢/mile for 2024)
- Health insurance premiums
- Retirement contributions (SEP, Solo 401k)
- Self-employment tax deduction (50%)
- Business equipment and supplies

## RSU and Stock Compensation

### Critical: Cost Basis for RSUs

**The RSU Double-Tax Trap:**
- RSU cost basis = Fair Market Value at VESTING (not $0!)
- Brokers often report $0 or wrong basis on 1099-B
- If you use wrong basis, you pay tax twice on the same income

**Correct Reporting:**
1. Find vesting date and FMV from employer records
2. Calculate: Basis = Shares × FMV at vesting
3. If 1099-B is wrong, use Form 8949 with code "B"
4. Report correct basis in column (e)

**Example:**
- 100 RSU shares vest when stock = $50
- You already paid income tax on $5,000 (reported on W-2)
- Later sell at $60/share for $6,000
- Correct gain: $6,000 - $5,000 = $1,000
- Wrong (if basis=$0): $6,000 - $0 = $6,000 (WRONG!)

---

## Estimated Tax Payments

### Who Needs to Pay

You may need estimated payments if:
- Self-employment income
- Investment income
- Not enough withholding
- Expect to owe $1,000+ at filing

### Safe Harbor Rules

**Avoid penalties by paying:**
- 100% of prior year tax, OR
- 90% of current year tax

*If prior year AGI > $150K ($75K MFS): 110% of prior year*

### 2024 Due Dates

| Quarter | Due Date |
|---------|----------|
| Q1 (Jan-Mar) | April 15, 2024 |
| Q2 (Apr-May) | June 17, 2024 |
| Q3 (Jun-Aug) | September 16, 2024 |
| Q4 (Sep-Dec) | January 15, 2025 |

## Tax Calculation Example

**Input:**
- Single filer, age 35
- W-2 wages: $85,000
- 401(k) contribution: $10,000 (already excluded from W-2)
- Traditional IRA: $3,000
- Student loan interest: $1,500

**Calculation:**
```
Gross Income:           $85,000
- IRA Contribution:     -$3,000
- Student Loan Int:     -$1,500
= AGI:                  $80,500

- Standard Deduction:   -$14,600
= Taxable Income:       $65,900

Tax Calculation:
  10% on $11,600:       $1,160
  12% on $35,550:       $4,266
  22% on $18,750:       $4,125
                        -------
Total Tax:              $9,551

Effective Rate: 11.2%
Marginal Rate: 22%
```

## Filing Status Optimization

**Check These Scenarios:**

1. **Married Filing Separately**
   - Usually worse, but consider if:
   - One spouse has high medical expenses
   - Student loan repayment based on income
   - Liability protection needed

2. **Head of Household** (better than Single)
   - Must be unmarried
   - Pay >50% of household costs
   - Have qualifying person living with you

3. **Qualifying Surviving Spouse**
   - Available for 2 years after spouse's death
   - Must have dependent child
   - Gets MFJ rates and deduction
