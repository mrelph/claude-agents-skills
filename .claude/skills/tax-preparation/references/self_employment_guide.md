### Calculation Steps
1. Calculate net self-employment income (Schedule C profit or Schedule K-1)

3. Calculate Social Security tax on amount up to wage base
4. Calculate Medicare tax on total amount
5. Deduct half of SE tax on Form 1040 Schedule 1

### Example Calculation
```
Net SE income: $100,000
SE tax base: $100,000 x 0.9235 = $92,350
Social Security: $92,350 x 12.4% = $11,451
Medicare: $92,350 x 2.9% = $2,678
Total SE tax: $14,129
Above-the-line deduction: $7,065 (half of SE tax)

### Calculation Methods

#### Simplified Method
- $5 per square foot
- Maximum 300 square feet
- **Maximum deduction: $1,500**

#### Regular Method
- Calculate actual expenses proportionally

- Office-specific repairs
- Dedicated office equipment

**Indirect expenses** (proportional):
- Mortgage interest or rent
- Property taxes
- Utilities (electric, gas, water)
- Homeowners insurance
- Repairs and maintenance
- Depreciation of home

### Regular Method Example
```
Home: 2,000 sq ft, Office: 200 sq ft = 10%
Annual rent: $24,000 x 10% = $2,400
Utilities: $3,600 x 10% = $360
Renters insurance: $300 x 10% = $30
Internet: $1,200 x 50% = $600 (business use estimate)
Total home office deduction: $3,390
```

### Important Considerations
- Cannot exceed business income (carryforward for regular method)

- Document with photos and measurements

### Actual Expense Method
